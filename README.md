# Airline Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes airline data to optimize revenue, increase occupancy rates, and enhance customer experience. We use SQL for database management, Python for data analysis, and Power BI for visualization.

## Problem Statement

Our airline faces challenges like environmental regulations, higher taxes, and rising labor costs. We aim to identify strategies to increase occupancy rates, improve pricing, and enhance customer experience using data analysis.


## Datasets
dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/prashantverma13/airline-data-analysis-using-sql
Data from Kaggle stored in SQLite database with key tables:
- `aircrafts_data`
- `airports_data`
- `boarding_passes`
- `bookings`
- `flights`
- `seats`
- `ticket_flights`
- `tickets`

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning
- Check for missing values.
- Ensure data consistency.
- Validate data types.

### Data Analysis
- Exploratory analysis with Python.
- Calculate key metrics (e.g., seat occupancy rates).
- Identify trends and patterns.

### Data Visualization
- Power BI dashboard with:
  - Pie Chart: Seat distribution by aircraft.
  - Bar Chart: Seat occupancy rates by aircraft.
  - Line Chart: Booking trends.
  - Map: Flight routes and airports.

## Tools

- **SQL**: Database management.
- **Python**: Data analysis (`pandas`, `matplotlib`).
- **Power BI**: Dashboard creation.
- To open python file consisting of streamlit app use command "streamlit run airline_stats.py" where the file exists
  
## Results

- Identified low-performing flights.
- Developed data-driven pricing strategies.
- Enhanced customer experience through analysis.

## Conclusion

Data-driven methodologies help optimize airline operations, improve efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction.
